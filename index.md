## About me

My doctoral research sits at the intersection of urban planning and health justice. I work with frontline communities, leading climate adaptation strategies that shape community health and well-being.

My dissertation is a spatio-temporal analysis of the processes of \relocation along communities in San Juan (PR) and the embodied environmental and health experiences of relocated families. 

Dissertation committee: Linda Shi (chair), Jamila Michener, and Alex Nading.
